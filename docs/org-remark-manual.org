* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installation
:END:

This package is not available on ELPA or MELPA yet. Manual installation is required.

Ensure to have Org Mode 9.4 or later (tested on 9.4.2). This package uses ~org-collect-keywords~, which does not exist in an earlier version.

Store all the =.el= files in the repo in your load-path and put this in your
init file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Set `load-path' , load `org-remark-global-tracking', and turn it on for
  ;; automatic loading of highlights for the files tracked
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/local-repos/org-remark")
  (require 'org-remark-global-tracking)
  (org-remark-global-tracking-mode +1)
#+end_src

Unless you explicitly load =org= during Emacs initialization, I suggest to defer loading =org-remark= (thus there is no =(require 'org-remark)= in the example above). This is because it will also pull in =org=, which can slow down initialization. By autoloading some commands in similar ways as the example keybindings below, you can control the timing of loading =org-remark=. 

Below are example keybindings you might like to consider:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Key-bind `org-remark-mark' to global-map so that you can call it globally
  ;; before the library is loaded.  In order to make `org-remark-mark' and
  ;; `org-remark-mode' callable, use `autoload'.
  (autoload #'org-remark-mark "org-remark" nil t)
  (autoload #'org-remark-mode "org-remark" nil t)
  (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c n m") #'org-remark-mark)

  ;; The rest of keybidings are done only on loading `org-remark'
  (with-eval-after-load 'org-remark
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n o") #'org-remark-open)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n ]") #'org-remark-view-next)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n [") #'org-remark-view-prev)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n r") #'org-remark-remove))
#+end_src

* Getting Started
** Highlighting and Annotating

#+findex: org-remark-mark
#+findex: org-remark-open
#+findex: org-remark-view

Once you have installed and set it up (refer to section [[#installation][Installation]]), Org-remark is simple to use. Simply select one[fn:1] and call =M-x org-remark-mark= to highlight a part of text. You will see the selected text gets highlighted. That's it.

To add or display the marginal notes for the highlight you have just marked, place your cursor on the highlight and call =M-x org-remark-open= or =M-x org-remark-view=. This will display a new buffer to the left of the current buffer you are editing. The =open= command takes the cursor to the marginal notes buffer to edit notes; whereas the =view= command keeps the cursor in the current buffer only to display the marginal notes. Both commands narrow the marginal notes file to the entry for the highlight under the cursor.  The marginal notes file is a normal Org file. Edit your notes just as you would do with any other Org files and save the buffer.

[fn:1] Set a mark and activate a region in Emacs terminology.

** Navigating from One Highlight to Another

#+findex: org-remark-view-next
#+findex: org-remark-view-prev
#+findex: org-remark-remove

After you have added a couple of highlights in the text, you can jump around to the next or previous highlights easily. Use =org-remark-view-next= and =org-remark-view-prev= to brows the marginal notes as you move from one highlight to another. They display the marginal notes on the side-window. Or use =org-remark-next= and =org-remark-prev= if you simply move to though highlights wihtout displaying marginal notes for them.

To make it easy to navigate, you can use the same "prefix key" to Org-remark commands, like this:

- =C-c n o= :: =org-remark-open=
- =C-c n ]= :: =org-remark-view-next=
- =C-c n [= :: =org-remark-view-prev=
- =C-c n r= :: =org-remark-remove=

The =C-c n= are the prefix key common to all of them. If you set the keybindings like this, you can use =C-c n ]= once to view the next highlight, and simply keep using a single key =]= or =[= to browse the next/previuos highlights. After you have reached the one you like to act on, press =o= to open it, or =r= to remove it.

** Create Your Own Custom Highlighter Pens

#+findex: org-remark-create
#+findex: org-remark-mark-yellow
#+findex: org-remark-mark-red-line

Org-remark has a default highlighter pen function, and comes with a set of two additional pens by default:

- =org-remark-mark=           :: default highlighter pen
- =org-remark-mark-yellow=    :: yellow highlight with "important" category in the marginal notes entry
- =org-remark-mark-red-line=  :: wavy red underline with "review" category in the marginal notes entry and "Review this" in tooltips

Org-remark does not stop there; it lets you create your own custom pen functions with =org-remark-create=. Use the yellow and red line pens as examples, and create your own. Refer to [[#create-custom-pens][Create Your Own Custom Pens]] for how to do it. 

This is it. It's all to get you started. For more detail, refer to the rest of this user manual, especially the [[#usage][Usage]] and [[#customizing][Customizing]] sections. There is more detail to the commands introduced in this section and more ways in which you can customize Org-remark. 

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: usage
:END:


#+cindex: Marginal notes file
#+cindex: Org-remark properties for highlights

** Highlighting and Annotating

You can leave the marginal notes file as it is without writing any notes. In this case, the entries in marginal notes file simply save the locations of your highlighted text. After you quit Emacs,  re-start it, and visit the same main file, Org-remark uses this information to highlight the text again. You can also directly edit the marginal notes file as a normal Org file.


At the same time Org-remark will automatically create a *marginal notes file*. 




[[#customizing][By default]], it will be named =marginalia.org= and created in the same directory as the file you are editing.

[[#customizing][By default]]


The important thing to note is that Org-remark uses following properties in the property drawer of the headline to remember the highlights:

- :org-remark-beg:
- :org-remark-end:
- :org-remark-id:
- :org-remark-label:

Essentially, the marginal notes file is a database in the plain text with using Org mode. As a plain text database, you can easily edit these properties manually if necessary.



** Automatically Load Highlights after Re-starting Emacs

#+findex: org-remark-global-tracking-mode
#+findex: org-remark-mode
#+vindex: org-remark-tracking-file

It is recommended that =org-remark-global-tracking-mode= be turned on as part of your Emacs initalization. This should be done before you start adding hightlights in any file. 

Once you have added highlights to some files, quit Emacs, and re-start it, active =org-remark-global-tracking-mode= will automatically turn on =org-remark-mode= and load the highlights from your previous sessions for the files being globally tracked.

When activated, =org-remark-global-tracking-mode= will also start remembering and tracking the files to which you add highlights and annotations. When you quit Emacs, it will save the tracked files in a file in your Emacs config directory (=user-emacs-directory=). [[#customizing][By default]], this file is named =.org-remark-tracking=.

Without this global minor mode, you would need to remember to activate =org-remark-mode= for each file where you add highlihgts and annotation. This is often unpractical. 



** Commands

- =org-remark-global-tracking-mode= ::
A global minor mode to save and track files that have marginal notes.
When active, visiting a file being tracked automatically turns on =org-remark-mode=, which loads highlights previously saved in the remark file.

The files being tracked are saved in =org-remark-tracking-file=, which you can customize. The default file is named =.org-remark-tracking= in your Emacs configuration directory (=user-emacs-directory=).

- =org-remark-mode= ::
Org-remark is a local minor mode. Toggle it on/off with using =org-remark-mode=. On activating, it loads your saved highlights from the remark file (defined by =org-remark-notes-file-path=), and enables automatic saving of highlights. The automatic saving is achieved via function =org-remark-save= added to =after-save-hook=.

- =org-remark-mark= ::
Select a region of text, and call =org-remark-mark= to highlight the region. It will generate a new ID, and start tracking the location -- so you can edit text around the highlighted text. Do not cut, copy and paste as the highlight will disappear (you can immediately =undo= to recover the text region along the highlights). To create a new marginal note entry in the remark file, save the buffer.

- =org-remark-save= ::
By default, Org-remark automatically creates or updates corresponding entries in the remark file with location and text of highlights on saving the buffer. Nevertheless, you can manually call =org-remark-save= to do so (automatic process also call this command).

If user option =org-remark-use-org-id= is non-nil, Org-remark will
create a link back to the source note with using an Org-ID link instead of a
normal file link.

When a new remark file is created and =org-remark-use-org-id= is
non-nil, Org-remark will add an ID property to the file level. This is mainly to support Org-roam's backlink feature for remark files.

- =org-remark-open= ::
Move your cursor on the highlighted text, and call =org-remark-open= to open the relevant margin notes in a separate window. Your cursor will move to the remark buffer narrowed to the relevant margin notes entry. You can edit the remark buffer as a normal Org buffer. Once you have done editing, you may simply save and close the it (kill it or close the window) as per your normal workflow. Technically, the remark buffer is a cloned indirect buffer of the remark file. 

- =org-remark-load= ::
This command visits the remark file and loads the saved highlights onto the current buffer. If there is no margin notes for it, it will output a message in the echo. Highlights tracked locally by Org-remark cannot persist when you kill the buffer, or quit Emacs. When you re-launch Emacs, ensure to turn on =org-remark-mode= to load the highlights. Loading is automatically done when you activate the minor mode.

- =org-remark-remove= ::
This command removes the highlight at point. It will remove the highlight, and remove the properties from the remark, but will keep the headline and notes in tact.

You can pass a universal argument (=C-u= by default). If this is the case, the command additionally deletes the entire heading subtree, along with the notes you have written, for the highlight.

- =org-remark-next= ::
Move to the next highlight if any. If there is none below the cursor, and there is a highlight above, loop back to the top one.
If the point has moved to the next highlight, this function enables transient map with `set-transient-map'. You don't have to press the keybinding prefix again to move further to the next. That is, you can do a key sequence like this:

   =C-c n ] ] ] ]=

If you have the same prefix for `org-remark-prev', you can combine it in
the sequence like so:

  =C-c n ] ] [ [=
  This lets your cursor back to where you started (next next prev prev)

- =org-remark-prev= ::
Move to the previous highlight if any. If there is none above the cursor, and there is a highlight below, loop back to the bottom one. This function enables transient map. See =org-remark-next= for detail.

- =org-remark-toggle= ::
Toggle showing/hiding of highlighters in current buffer. It only affects the display of the highlighters. When hidden, highlights' locations are still kept tracked; thus, upon buffer-save the correct locations are still recorded in the remark file.

** Keybindings Examples

`Org-remark` only provides its mode map, and does not bind any keys to it. As an example, you could do something like this below.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n o") #'org-remark-open)
(define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c m") #'org-remark-mark)
(define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n ]") #'org-remark-next)
(define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n [") #'org-remark-prev)
#+end_src

** Composing Personal Workflow

Currently only "elementary" functions are defined in the package; for example,  =mark= , =save=, and =open= are all separate functions. You can string these together to compose a more fluid operation to suite your own workflow. A very useful set of such chained commands have been suggesetd by holtzermann17 in [[https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/prototype-org-remark-write-margin-notes-with-org-mode/1080/10][Org-roam's Discourse discussion]] (adjusted to reflect the change of the prefix from =om/= to =org-remark-=) .

I will try to incorporate these into the package when I have more time to focus on it -- I find them useful, but there are some plans I have had, and want to think of how I can incoprate these suggestions better with my ideas. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun org-remark-make-annotation ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((mark-end (region-end)))
      (org-remark-mark (region-beginning) (region-end))
      (org-remark-save)
      (org-remark-open (1- mark-end))
      (end-of-buffer)))

  (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c M")
    #'org-remark-make-annotation)

  (defun org-remark-browse-forward ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((buf (current-buffer)))
      (org-remark-next) (org-remark-open (point))
      (pop-to-buffer buf nil t)))

  (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n }")
    #'org-remark-browse-forward)

  (defun org-remark-browse-backward ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((buf (current-buffer)))
      (org-remark-prev) (org-remark-open (point))
      (pop-to-buffer buf nil t)))

  (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n {")
    #'org-remark-browse-backward)
#+end_src

Org-remark has a default highlighter pen function, and comes with a set of two additional pens [[#customizing][by default]]:

- =org-remark-mark= : default highlighter pen
- =org-remark-mark-yellow=
- =org-remark-mark-red-line=

Org-remark lets you create your own custom pen functions with =org-remark-create=. See how "red-line" and "yellow" pens are created. They are meant to be a starter pack and examples. 

#+begin_src elisp
  (org-remark-create "red-line"
                     '(:underline (:color "dark red" :style wave))
                     '(CATEGORY "review" help-echo "Review this"))
  (org-remark-create "yellow"
                     '(:underline "gold" :background "lemon chiffon")
                     '(CATEGORY "important"))
#+end_src

#+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag CAUTION
#+begin_quote
Don't use category (symbol) as a property -- it's a special one of text properties. If you use it, the value also need to be a symbol; otherwise, you will get an error. You can use CATEGORY (symbol and all uppercase), which will result in CATEGORY in the property drawer in marginal notes Org files.
#+end_quote



- You can customize settings in the =org-remark= group.
- Highlight's face can be changed via =org-remark-highlighter=
- Remark file is defined by =org-remark-notes-file-path=
- Your files with marginal notes are saved and tracked in
  =org-remark-tracking-file= (when tracking is turned on via the global
  minor mode =org-remark-global-tracking-mode=)
- You can use Org-ID to create links from marginal notes back to their main
  notes when =org-remark-use-org-id= is on (default is on). This option also enables Org-remark to add an ID property when a new remark file is being created. This is to support seamless workflow with [[https://orgroam.com][Org-roam]].

* Known Limitations

- Copy & pasting loses highlights :: Overlays are not part of the kill; thus cannot be yanked.
  
- Undo highlight does not undo it :: Overlays are not part of the undo list; you cannot undo highlighting. Use =org-remark-remove= command instead.
  
- Moving source files and remark file :: Move your files and remark file to another directory does not update the source path recorded in the remark file. It will be confusing. Try not to do this.

* Credits

To create this package, I was inspired by the following packages. I did not copy any part of them, but borrowed some ideas from them -- e.g. saving the margin notes in a separate file.

- [[https://github.com/jkitchin/ov-highlight][Ov-highlight]] :: John Kitchin's (author of Org-ref). Great UX for markers with hydra. Saves the marker info and comments directly within the Org file as Base64 encoded string. It uses overlays with using `ov` package.
  
- [[https://github.com/bastibe/annotate.el][Annotate.el]] :: Bastian Bechtold's (author of Org-journal). Unique display of annotations right next to (or on top of) the text. It seems to be designed for very short annotations, and perhaps for code review (programming practice); I have seen recent issues reported when used with variable-pitch fonts (prose).
  
- [[https://github.com/tkf/org-mode/blob/master/contrib/lisp/org-annotate-file.el][Org-annotate-file]] :: Part of Org's contrib library. It seems to be designed to annotate a whole file in a separate Org file, rather than specific text items.
  
- [[https://github.com/IdoMagal/ipa.el][InPlaceAnnotations (ipa-mode)]] :: It looks similar to Annotate.el above.
  
- Transient navigation feature :: To implement the transient navigation feature, I liberally copied the relevant code from a wonderful Emacs package, [[https://github.com/rnkn/binder/blob/24d55db236fea2b405d4bdc69b4c33d0f066059c/binder.el#L658-L665][Binder]] by Paul W. Rankin (GitHub user [[https://github.com/rnkn][rnkn]]).
