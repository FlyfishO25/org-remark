* Changes

  - chg: Save marginal notes on `mark' instead of wainting for `save'
  
  - chg: define org-remark-mark explicitly for autoload cookie

  - chg: `org-remark-visit' and `org-remark-open'. Visit will stay in the
          current main note; open will move the cursor to the marginal notes
          buffer for further editing.

  - chg: When updating the existing headline and position properties, don't
         update the headline text when it already exists. Let the user decide
         how to manage headlines.
